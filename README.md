Builder Pattern Practice

Objective: Coding a program that builts 4 different types of shoes (with laces, heels, ergonomic and with velcro), using the builder pattern!

For built a pair of shoes, the app takes every part, with their own characterics, and then, the Builder files (Interface and java class) unit every part into one to get a shoe. The Builder Director classifies them according to the type of shoe that you want to build.

To see the UML of the project check the file named -> UML_Shoes_Builder_Pattern
